# Very-Long-Periods
A semi-complete list of VERY long period eclipsing binary star systems.

The number of eclipsing binaries goes down rapidly with increasing period, both due to geometry (i.e. less likely to be eclipsing), and probably the intrinsic distribution. Very long period systems are rare, and quite interesting since e.g. they don't have strong tidal or dynamical interactions. They're also super neat, since they take decades to observe, and we should continue to monitor them forever.

To be included in [this list](EBs.md), systems must be:
  - Eclipsing (not just spectroscopic binaries, though they are also [very interesting](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...600L...9J/abstract)... maybe we'll make a second list!)
  - Have a reasonably confirmed orbital period (at _least_ 2 eclipses, 3 is better)
  - Have orbital periods of $P \ge 2000$ days
  - ... anything else?
